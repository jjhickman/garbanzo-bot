        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="legal-meta">Effective date: 2026-02-16</p>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how Garbanzo Bean ("Garbanzo", "we", "us", "our") handles information when operating
          garbanzobot.com, the live demo at <a href="https://demo.garbanzobot.com">demo.garbanzobot.com</a>, and Garbanzo chat automation services.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information we process</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Account and profile details you provide in messaging platforms (for example, display name and platform identifiers).</li>
          <li>Message content sent to chats where Garbanzo is enabled, including commands and bot interactions.</li>
          <li>Operational metadata such as timestamps, group identifiers, health status, and delivery/retry events.</li>
          <li>Configuration and support communications you send to us directly (including email support requests).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide AI-assisted chat operations, commands, summaries, moderation signals, and related workflows.</li>
          <li>To maintain reliability, safety, abuse prevention, debugging, and incident response.</li>
          <li>To improve product quality, routing behavior, and deployment stability.</li>
          <li>To communicate support, operational updates, and policy changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-party processors</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on enabled features and deployment configuration, data may be processed by third-party providers,
          including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Messaging infrastructure providers (for example, official messaging platform services).</li>
          <li>AI model providers (for example, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, or locally hosted inference).</li>
          <li>Optional external data APIs used by specific features (for example, weather, transit, or news providers).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          Garbanzo stores runtime and operational data needed to provide service functionality. Retention settings may vary by
          deployment and can be adjusted by the operator. We aim to keep only what is needed for service delivery,
          troubleshooting, and safety.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable technical and operational measures to protect service data. No method of storage or transmission
          is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Your choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You may stop interacting with Garbanzo-enabled chats at any time.</li>
          <li>Operators can disable features, adjust retention settings, and remove integrations.</li>
          <li>You may contact us to request account-related support questions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children's privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Garbanzo is not directed to children under 13 and is intended for community/team operations contexts.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Policy updates</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updated versions will be posted at this page with a revised
          effective date.
        </p>
