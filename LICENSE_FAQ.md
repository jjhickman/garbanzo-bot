## Can I use Garbanzo for personal projects?

Yes. Personal use for hobby projects, private entertainment, research, and learning is noncommercial under the license.

## Can I use Garbanzo for a community group or nonprofit?

Yes. The license explicitly permits use by charitable organizations, educational institutions, public research, public safety/health, environmental protection, and government institutions.

## Can my company use Garbanzo internally?

A short trial is permitted.

Ongoing use inside a for-profit company is commercial use and requires a commercial license.

## Can I offer Garbanzo as a hosted service for clients?

No, not without a commercial license.

## Can I modify Garbanzo?

Yes. You can modify and share changes under the same license terms. If you contribute changes back under a standard public software license (MIT/Apache/Blue Oak/BSD-2), that contribution activity does not count as commercial use.

## What about contractors/consultants?

If you are paid to set up or run Garbanzo for someone else, that is commercial use.

## Why this license?

The goal is to keep Garbanzo accessible to individuals and community organizers while preventing free-riding commercial usage.
