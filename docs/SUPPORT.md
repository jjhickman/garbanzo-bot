# Support Garbanzo

Garbanzo is sustained by community sponsorship and commercial licensing.

## Public Support Links

## Patreon Tier Strategy

See `docs/PATREON_SETUP.md` for copy/paste profile text, welcome message, goals, and FAQ snippets.

These tiers are designed to convert community support while staying aligned with the project license model.

1. **Bean Backer** (`$5/month`)
   - Helps cover hosting and maintenance costs
   - Access to monthly project update posts

2. **Community Operator** (`$15/month`)
   - Everything in Bean Backer
   - Priority voting on roadmap polls and feature focus

3. **Automation Ally** (`$35/month`)
   - Everything in Community Operator
   - Quarterly operations write-ups (release workflow, reliability lessons)

4. **Guild Partner** (`$99/month`)
   - Everything in Automation Ally
   - One monthly async advisory thread for deployment and architecture questions

5. **Commercial Pathfinder** (`$299/month`)
   - Everything in Guild Partner
   - Dedicated commercial-license intake + faster quote turnaround
   - Includes planning guidance, not a commercial license grant

## Licensing Alignment (Important)

Patreon support does **not** grant commercial rights.

- Commercial usage is governed by `LICENSE` and `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md`.
- Patreon is a support channel and lead-in for organizations that may later need a commercial license.
