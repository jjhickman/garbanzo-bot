## Tagline

Community AI that actually helps your group make plans and follow through.

## Creator About Section (copy/paste)

Garbanzo is an AI community operations bot built for real group chats, not demo rooms.

It helps organizers and active communities handle the repetitive stuff that kills momentum: scheduling, event logistics, reminders, summaries, moderation signals, and owner workflows.

Your support keeps development moving and infrastructure reliable. We use sponsorship funding for hosting, release engineering, test coverage, and practical quality-of-life features requested by the community.

Patreon support does not grant commercial usage rights. Commercial usage is covered separately via our commercial license process.
